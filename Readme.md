How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I have done this assessment in 2 days,per day I spent  2.5 hours for coding test.if I had more time to spend on that I would would like to try to create whole website which is Dynamic with responsive,and if I have face any issue during that I will ask my guide for help or about the issue I wI'll search to complete my work..





How would you track down a performance issue in production?Hve you ever had to do this?
I am a fresher so I can't answer this question properly but if I had face some exceptions during compile the code or run the code firstly I checked what type of exception arise.There are many types of exceptions like symbolic, logical, warning for Not Found a Path so if that type of exception occurs I  fixed it..
